                "markdown": "# Deep Dive: Mixture of Experts\n\n> **Core Concept:** MoE models use a \"router\" network to select a subset of \"expert\" networks to process each token.\n\n### Why it matters?\nTraditional dense models activate **all** parameters for every input. MoE models only activate a fraction (e.g., 10-15%), significantly reducing FLOPs per inference.\n\n### Pseudocode Logic\n```python\ndef forward(x):\n  # Router decides which expert gets the token\n  weights, indices = router(x)\n  \n  # Only run selected experts\n  output = 0\n  for i, expert in enumerate(experts):\n      if i in indices:\n          output += weights[i] * expert(x)\n  return output\n```\n\n### Key Benefits\n*   **Scalability:** Train trillion-parameter models cheaply.\n*   **Latency:** Faster inference than dense equivalents.\n*   **Specialization:** Experts can specialize in code, math, or creative writing."

Tiered Caching Strategy\nUse **Context Caching** for large, static assets to reduce token usage:\n*   API Documentation\n*   Codebase Snapshots\n*   Brand Style Guides\n\n### 2. Model Selection\n*   **Complex Reasoning:** Use *Gemini 1.5 Pro*\n*   **High Volume / Chat:** Use *Gemini 1.5 Flash*\n*   **Offline / Privacy:** Use *Gemma 2* (Self-hosted)\n\n> **Note:** Flash is approx. 10x cheaper for simple RAG tasks than Pro.\n\n### Action Items\n*   Refactor API client to support caching headers.\n*   Benchmark latency between Pro and Flash for your specific use case."
